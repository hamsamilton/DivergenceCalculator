\title{Standardize read depth across samples}
\usage{
StandardizeReadDepth(
  df,
  numreads = 1e+06,
  ntimes = 1,
  parallel = FALSE,
  cores = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or matrix where rows are genes and columns are samples. Row names should be gene identifiers.}

\item{numreads}{Number of reads to downsample to. Default is 1,000,000.}

\item{ntimes}{Number of times to perform the downsampling. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame with standardized read counts.
}
\description{
Standardizes read depth across samples by downsampling to a specified number of reads.
Columns with fewer reads than the specified number are skipped.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Standardize read depth to 500,000 reads
standardized_counts <- StandardizeReadDepth(expression_matrix, numreads = 5e5)

# Take the average of 3 downsamples to 3e6 trsfd
standardized_counts <- StandardizeReadDepth(expression_matrix, numreads = 1e6, ntimes = 3)
}
